# allergist-task-CI

## Description
* Code for experiments using a standard allergist task with foods as cues and allergic reaction as the outcome

## NSW27
* This experiment uses a feature-negative training design (A+ AB-) to assess conditioned inhibition
* Assesses causal structure via a 3AFC question (prevention, modulation, configural)

## NSW30
* This experiment is a replication of NSW27 with an additional between-subjects hint manipulation to induce a causal structure (prevention, modulation, configural)
